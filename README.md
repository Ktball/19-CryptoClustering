# 19-CryptoClustering
 Unsupervised Learning

Module 19 Challenge used our knowledge of Python and Unsupervised Learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

This module was completed primarily by reviewing the activities completed in class and the zoom recordings.  I did speak with a tutor, Shivek, provided through the free edX tutoring sessions. Our discussion revolved around the overall concepts of unsupervised learning and interpretation of the visualizations.
